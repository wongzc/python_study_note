python important learning points
1. class: use when need attribute+method, center of OOP
    - encapsulatiopn: data/attribute + method
    - inheritance, cleaner, lesser repeat code
    - polymorphism: diffeernt class, but if have same method name, can polymorphism call
    - abstract: create a template ( use abc.ABC & abc.abstarctmethod) with essentiate method defined ( with pass only)

2. python is compiled to byttecode, and run by python-virtual-machine (PVM, interpreter), while c++ is compiled to machine code, run by CPU
3. mutable datatype can be changed after create, list/dict/set
    - immutable can only be reassigned, memory address changed
